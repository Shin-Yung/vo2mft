This is *consistent* with expected behavior:
    m ~ "sublattice magnetization": finite at low temperature, vanishes at high temperature.
    Keep finite w at high temperature to increase entropy.
        Why is it increasing with temperature? - entropy contribution?
    mu becomes more negative with increasing temperature.

--- Also remove mu from hoppingEV
